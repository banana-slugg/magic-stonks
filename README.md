This is a simple program that sends data from [MTGStocks](https://www.mtgstocks.com/interests) to a Discord webhook using [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) and [chromedp](https://github.com/chromedp/chromedp).

Information on webhooks and how to create them can be found [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
